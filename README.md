# Stopwatch Feature
A self-made, simple clock application made with Python and the Kivy framework. Limited in functionality and appearance, but is continually updated.

The app displays the current local time, and has a stopwatch feature with basic functionality.

All setting options (apart from chaning the colour) work.

I'm new to Kivy, so just making a simple project to become more comfortable with how Kivy works.

## Change Log

### 28/12/22:

Stopwatch feature completed; 'stopwatch-feature' branch merged to 'main'.

### 24/12/22:

'stopwatch-feature' branch created to work on the stopwatch feature of the program.

### 21/12/22:

Added option to enable/disable both the 'day of week' and 'year' option. This time, instead of adding and removing the Label widget that holds the date, the Label is now always there but the date contents are added to and removed from it as appropriate.

Added option to enable/disable the 'day and month' option.
