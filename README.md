# Clock-App
A self-made, simple clock application made with Python and the Kivy framework. Limited in functionality and appearance, but is continually updated.

The app displays the current local time. You can press the gear icon on the bottom left which brings up the settings. It also has a stopwatch feature with basic functionality.

All setting options (apart from chaning the colour) work.

(By mistake I commited this early stopwatch feature to the main branch. From now on the stopwatch feature will be in the 'stopwatch-feature' branch and will be merged once completed).

I'm new to Kivy, so just making a simple project to become more comfortable with how Kivy works.

## Change Log

### 21/12/22:

Added option to enable/disable both the 'day of week' and 'year' option. This time, instead of adding and removing the Label widget that holds the date, the Label is now always there but the date contents are added to and removed from it as appropriate.

### 21/12/22:

Added option to enable/disable the 'day and month' option.
