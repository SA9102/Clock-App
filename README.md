# Clock-App
A self-made, simple clock application made with Python and the Kivy framework. Limited in functionality and appearance, but is continually updated.

The app displays the current local time. You can press the gear icon on the bottom left which brings up the settings.

Currently, only the 'Seconds' and 'Day + Month' options work.

I'm new to Kivy, so just making a simple project to become more comfortable with how Kivy works.
